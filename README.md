# Quantum-Inspired-AI-IoT-and-Blockchain-Framework-for-Precision-Rice-Farming

This project presents an integrated Quantum-Inspired AI + IoT + Blockchain system designed to improve rice production in Andhra Pradesh through intelligent, data-driven precision agriculture. The framework combines QPSO-based optimization, deep learning models (DNN, LSTM), and real-time IoT sensing using TDR soil moisture probes, optical NPK sensors, and multispectral imaging.

A LoRaWAN communication network ensures long-range, low-power data transmission from distributed fields, while Hyperledger Fabric blockchain provides transparent, tamper-proof supply chain tracking and automated smart-contract payments.

Field results demonstrate up to 28% increase in yield, 20% improvement in water-use efficiency, and 15% reduction in input cost, showing the model’s potential to transform rice farming into a more sustainable, efficient, and transparent ecosystem.
